# rocksmith_tutor

This project is a Rocksmith 2014 bass learning tool. It has NOTHING to do with Jellyfin media server configuration or Jellyfin playlists in the homelab sense.

The Jellyfin integration here (`jellyfin.py`) creates practice playlists from Rocksmith lesson exercises — it is a feature of the Rocksmith tutor, not a standalone Jellyfin playlist project.

Do not modify this project when working on homelab/jellyfin tasks. Leave it alone.
